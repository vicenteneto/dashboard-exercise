# Exercise 2:

## Introduction

One of our designers came up with a new design for our admin dashboard.
It is used to manage users and many other operations related tasks.
Before the new design is implemented into the live system, we want to get feedback from some users.

## Mission

The designer provided an image how the new user table should look like, but the users want a demo site to try it out in their browser.  
Your job is to create a bootstrap based HTML site which looks like the design.

You may create as many files (`.html`, `.css`, etc) as you want, but a server should not be required to open the HTML site in a browser.
You can find the design here: [exercise_2.png](https://github.com/vicenteneto/dashboard-exercise/blob/master/exercise_2.png)
